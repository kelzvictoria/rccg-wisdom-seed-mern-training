1. What does CSS stands for?
  Answer
CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet and its used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML.

2. What are the simple CSS Selectors?
  Answer
 Simple selectors (select elements based on name,id,class)
(a) Element selector -	The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
 Syntax: p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
           }
(b) The CSS Id Selector - The Id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The Id of an element is unique within a page, so the Id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific Id, write a (#) character, followed by the Id of the element.
Syntax: The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1".
        #para1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
              }
Note: An Id name cannot start with a number!
(c) The CSS class Selector - The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period(.) character, followed by the class name. 
Syntax: All HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:
       .center{
         text-align: center;
         color: red;
         }
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
Syntax: Only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:
       p.center {
          text-align: center;
          color: red;
              }
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
Syntax: The <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":
        <p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
Note: A class name cannot start with a number!
(d) The CSS Universal Selector
  The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
Syntax: The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page:
        * {
          text-align: center;
          color: blue;
          }

4. Go to w3schools.com.css, read more about CSS, Responsive web design, CSS icons and write short notes on what you learn.
   Answer
        CSS
  CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
 CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
 CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
 External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
   CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
 A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
Syntax: h1 {color:blue; font-size:12px}
 The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
 The declaration block contains one or more declarations seperated by semicolons.
 Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
 Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
Example: In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:
   p {
      color: red;
      text-align: center;
      }
Example in Details:
 * p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
 * color is a property, and red is the property value
 * text-align is a property, and center is the property value.

         RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN
 Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
 A reponsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
 Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices
 (desktops, tablets, and phones).
 Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device.

       CSS ICONS
 Icons can easily be added to your HTML page, by using an icon library.
 The simplest way to add an icon to your HTML page, is with an icon library, such as Font Awesome.
   How To Add Icons
  Add the name of the specified icon class to any inline HTML element (like <i> or <span>).
  All the icons in the icon libraries below, are scalable vectors that can be customized with CSS (size, color, shadow, etc).
